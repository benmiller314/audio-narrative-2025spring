This file is explaining what the preview update is meant to display in the audio narrative project process. So far, I have gather a solid amount of assets which can be seen in assets.md. In addition, I also have started working on my project, in which we can see that I've set the scene for the beginning. This is visible in both the mp3 file and the Audacity file where I am creating a setting of an early morning, with birds chirping in the background, and an alarm clock fading in as primary foreground. I want to give the idea that our main character is being introduced by the alarm clock, and we begin to see that this person is slowly waking up to start their day. Afterwards, we hear them tapping on their phone, which represents going through into an app to play music. While this isn't implied in the audio clip, I want to make it so that the final loud "tap" at the end of the mp3 file signals the start of the song which I will include as background audio during the narrative. I am going to record the music myself, and it will be a jazz standard piece most likely. This is to continue making the setting calm and relaxed, letting the listener's know that the main character probably isn't doing much this morning. The next step after the music will be transitioning to the main character getting ready to make breakfast, with them using the bathroom to brush their teeth. Some key audio here would be footsteps, water running, and splashing water. I think overall the project is coming along so far, and I want to continue making the theme of the narrative relaxed, since the goal is to have a sudden twist ending.
